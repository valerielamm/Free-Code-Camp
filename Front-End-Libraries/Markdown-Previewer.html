<!-- 
Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Markdown Previewer

Requirements

#1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".
#2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".
#3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
#4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
#5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
#6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

Optional Bonus: When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab.
Optional Bonus: My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br elements.
